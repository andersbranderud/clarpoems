I shall never achieve\nA magpie heart, a hairy nostril over the beak, a flight\nThat always renews just when coming down,\nAnd so I shall never comprehend magpiety.\nIf however magpiety does not exist\nMy nature does not exist either.\nWho would have guessed that, centuries later,\nI would invent the question of universals?",
